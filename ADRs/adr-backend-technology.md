# Backend technology 

## Summary

The project has an relevant component: the backend who is the core of application, so it's necessary define the technology to develop it.


### Alternatives

- Java
- Phyton

## Decision 

Alternative selected: *Phyton*


Folowing table contains all reasons that drive us to make previos decision:

| Criteria                 | Description                                                    
| --------------------     | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | 
| Usability                | Python is simpler and easier to learn.	   						                                       |
| Most In-Demand           | In the last years, Phyton becomes more demanded than Java.	                                           |
| Offer                    | Due to the high demand more developers choose it, so it's easier to find developers to conform a team.                                         																					 |
| Deliverability           | Python is dynamically typed, so it's fast and friendly for development. In addition, it uses asynchronous code to tackle situations and challenges faster because each unit of code runs separately.                                																					     |
| Boost productivity       | It allows to have an application with few lines of code, unlike to Java.                                   																					       |
| Community                | It's widely accepted by community with a large library supports common tasks and commands.			   |
| Usability                | It contains code that can be used for many different purposes, ranging from generating documentation to unit testing.																										       		    |
