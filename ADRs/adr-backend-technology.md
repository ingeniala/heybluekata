# Backend technology 

## Summary

The backend layer is the core component of the solution, so it's necessary to define the technology involved to build it.

### Alternatives

- Java
- Python

## Decision 

Alternative selected: *Python*

Following table contains all the reasons that drives the decision:

| Criteria                 | Description                                                    
| --------------------     | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | 
| Usability                | Python is simpler and easier to learn (lower learning curve). |
| Most In-Demand           | Over the last years, Python became a more demanded language than Java. |
| Offer                    | Due to the high demand, the community grows continuously, so it's easier to recruit developers to conform a team. |
| Deliverability           | Python is dynamically typed, so it's fast and friendly for development. In addition, it uses asynchronous code to tackle situations and challenges faster because each unit of code runs separately. |
| Boost productivity       | It allows to have a totally functional application within a few lines of code, unlike Java. |
| Community                | It's widely accepted by the community with a large amount of libraries supporting common tasks and use cases. |
| Usability                | It contains code that can be used for many different purposes, ranging from generating documentation to unit testing. |

## Constraints mapping
