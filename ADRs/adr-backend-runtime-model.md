# Backend runtime model

## Summary

An important decision we have to make is define the model to follow for the backend runtime, in order to have the best strategy in the use of resources.


### Alternatives

- Containers
- Serverless

## Decision 

Alternative selected: *Containers and Serverless*

Both of them were selected because each one is good for diferent scenarios. In the project we have many different needs, we have to solve, so it's necessary have a special care in order to know when and where use them, but both are necessary for the application.

**Note: In responsibilities description of each component will be explain "why" and "which" model was selected for it.**
