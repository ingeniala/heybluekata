# Civilian Onboarding flow

## Description

This flow describes the onboarding of a new Civilian, from its submission to the final approve and account creation. It also includes the verification of the actor as a civilian, and not a member of a family in needs, member of a Charity org or police officer.

It also map each business process with the conceptual component that will support it (more info in [README](/README.md#application-component-collaboration-views)).
