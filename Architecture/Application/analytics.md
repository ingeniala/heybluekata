# Analytics

## Description

As described in the previous section, once the durable data is in its place, then itâ€™s time to extract and make decisions out of it.

Main drivers on this choice were:

- ease to setup & maintain.
- no extra effort required, no work in-house.
- spend the least as possible in product licenses/subscriptions.
- no need to learn a bunch of technical stuff to visualize something useful ( https://www.metabase.com/blog/why-a-growth-marketing-team-wants-metabase).
- integrations with AWS analytics services, e.g. Athena (https://www.metabase.com/data_sources/amazon-athena). 
- community adoption & high maturity/support within the industry.

Given all these topics, the team came up with [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/) as a possible candidate which fits quite well. Actually, the idea is to add Athena as well, as a data extraction tool.
