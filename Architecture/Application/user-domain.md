# Users Domain

## Description

This component is key to the solution architecture as it will hold all the domain entities represented in the business logic: **Civilians, Merchants, Police Officers, Families in need, Charity** and the transactions between all of them.

It will expose APIs so it can provide the profile information for every entity involved, but also it will be fed with news about the model (transactions) so itâ€™s able to leave the model up-to-date.
