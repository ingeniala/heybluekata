# QR Generation

## Description

The team decided to represent the idea of a QR to record the encounter between a civilian and a police officer. 
This can be useful in case of:

- automatic instant match based on proximity does not work because of location issues.
- police officers are strongly against submitting their location constantly, so this could be a manual way of earning expected points by saying hello.

*How could this work?* Let’s say a civilian spots a police officer nearby, but not because of the app, which could mean that the officer is not sharing an active location. The civilian can approach and talk to the police officer wondering if he/she would use HeyBlue or even if it’s ok to just “match”. Then, civilians can show a QR which will contain the necessary information to create a transaction between them within the system.
