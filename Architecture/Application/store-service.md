## Store Service

## Description

The solution also needs to support a store service, so the _Merchants and Municipalities_ can manage their sites. In the case of _Merchants_, every one could add content for the products being offered for redemption. On the other hand, _Municipalities_ could present all availables types of fines that could be reedem by civilians. 

**Money cost** is one of the most important driver/restriction within the business requirements so in this case the team chooses to use [Prismic](https://prismic.io/) as a templating engine for sites creation. Prismic provides a plugin for Gatsby (a static site generator based on React with a lot of plugins) in order to deploy the site easily. 

This component is fully supported by Prismic like technical solution in the backend, and it's integrated with the [Content manager](#content-manager).
