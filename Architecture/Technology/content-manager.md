# Content Manager

## Runtime

In this case, the team proposes a run-to-completion serverless workload, like AWS Lambdas, as this component will not be used frequently and also the nature of this processing is a great fit for these kind of workloads (receive an event and then post to an async API).


## Storage

As was mentioned previously, the proposal for storage layer is AWS S3.

## Technology Views

For simplicity, it is provided two kinds of views. A simplified view generated using draw.io view that tells the story in a easier way, and the archimate view, useful for analytics purposes.
