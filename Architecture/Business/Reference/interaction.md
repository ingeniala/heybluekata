## Interaction - Motivation mapping

The figure 8.1.1 shows how the *interaction* business function support the functional requirements and how they are influenced by the architecture characteristics and constraints.

As we can see in the previous diagram, all the busines functions will participate in some way covering the Hey Blue architecture.
