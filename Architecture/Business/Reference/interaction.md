# Interaction

Business responsabilities associated to the interaction with the users of the social network.
Includes the following business functions:

##  Sharing

Asset sharing between users, based on profile and relation with the author of the content.

**As showing in the seccion [Interaction - Motivation mapping](#interaction---motivation-mapping), in this case the focus of the architecture defined will be on the capacity of share information to social networks.**

## Messaging

Direct messaging between users. Include:
* Text messages
* Email
* Voice Chat
* Video Char
* Reactions

**As showing in the seccion [Interaction - Motivation mapping](#interaction---motivation-mapping), in this case the focus of the architecture defined will be on the reactions capability, being the reactions the virtual handshake between actors.**

## Collaboration

Ability of a user to collaborate with other user or users, by interact with the contents or messaging shared.
Include the rules that govern the interactions.

**As showing in the seccion [Interaction - Motivation mapping](#interaction---motivation-mapping), in this case the focus of the architecture defined will be on the interactions through the virtual handshake between actors.**

## Connection

Ability of a user to find and connect with other users, bases on their profile and defined rules.

**As showing in the seccion [Interaction - Motivation mapping](#interaction---motivation-mapping), in this case the focus of the architecture defined will be on the connection between police officers and civilians, and the ability of police officers, family in needs and civilians to find retails, charity orgs or municipalities to redeem the points.**

## Interaction - Motivation mapping

The figure 8.1.1 shows how the *interaction* business function support the functional requirements and how they are influenced by the architecture characteristics and constraints.

As we can see in the previous diagram, all the busines functions will participate in some way covering the Hey Blue architecture.

## Interaction - Conceptual Architecture mapping

The figure below (figure 8.1.2) shows how the components of the conceptual architecture (more info in [Application Components Collaboration Views](/README.md#application-component-collaboration-views)) realize the Reference Architecture.
