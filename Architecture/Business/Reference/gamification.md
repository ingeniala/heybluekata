# Gamification

A social network needs to manage a way to incentivize the interaction between users. Gamification includes the functionality associated with the manage of this incentives, as described below:

## Score

Scoring management for each user, including the history of movements.

## Scoring Rules

Rules by a user can obtain points

## Redemption Rules

Rules by a user can redem points for prices, products or services.

## Gamification - Motivation mapping

The figure 8.4.1 shows how the *gamification* business function support the functional requirements and how they are influenced by the architecture characteristics and constraints.

As we can see in the previous diagram, all the busines functions will participate in some way covering the Hey Blue architecture.

## Gamification - Conceptual Architecture mapping

The figure (figure 8.4.2) below shows how the components of the conceptual architecture (more info in [Application Components Collaboration Views](/README.md#application-component-collaboration-views)) realize the Reference Architecture.
