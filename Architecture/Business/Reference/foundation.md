# Foundation

Foundation group the common functionalities that support the business of any social network, as described below:

## APIs

Application Program Interfaces that aim another developers to interact with the platform, converting the social network in a platform providing value to a broader ecosystem.

**As showing in the seccion [Foundation - Motivation mapping](#foundation---motivation-mapping), in this case the focus of the defined architecture will be on the basic features to ensure the expositions of backend APIs to the channels in a secure and controlled way.**

## Widgets

Widgets to create custom pages or application using the information of the platform (e.g. merchant commerce).

**As showing in the seccion [Foundation - Motivation mapping](#foundation---motivation-mapping), in this case the focus of the defined architecture will be on the basic features to ensure the ability to easily develop front end solutions, mainly the storefronts.**

## Analytics

Analytics capabilities, including

* Engagement
* Scoring
* Recommendations
* Trends

**As showing in the seccion [Foundation - Motivation mapping](#foundation---motivation-mapping), in this case the focus of the defined architecture will be on the features of analytics and archiving of the transactional data.**

## Notifications

Notification of the activity in the platform to a user, per instance via mobile or browser.

**As showing in the seccion [Foundation - Motivation mapping](#foundation---motivation-mapping), in this case the focus of the defined architecture will be on the features of notifications through email, web or mobile to the end users.**

## Authentication & Authorization

Authentication and authorization capabilities. Including the ability to validate the user credentials with a third party (e.g. oauth identity provider)

**As showing in the seccion [Foundation - Motivation mapping](#foundation---motivation-mapping), in this case the focus of the defined architecture will be on the features of authentication and authorization of the end users.**

## Content

Content management

**As showing in the seccion [Foundation - Motivation mapping](#foundation---motivation-mapping), in this case the focus of the defined architecture will be on the features of content management, mainly for front ends and storefronts.**

## Privacy and Security

Privacy and security management, including GDPR

**As showing in the seccion [Foundation - Motivation mapping](#foundation---motivation-mapping), in this case the focus of the defined architecture will be on the basic features to ensure the compliance with GDPR.**

## Foundation - Motivation mapping

The figure 8.5.1 shows how the *foundation* business function support the functional requirements and how they are influenced by the architecture characteristics and constraints.

As we can see in the previous diagram, all the busines functions will participate in some way covering the Hey Blue architecture.

## Foundation - Conceptual Architecture mapping

The figure below (figure 8.5.2) shows how the components of the conceptual architecture (more info in [Application Components Collaboration Views](/README.md#application-component-collaboration-views)) realize the Reference Architecture.
