The figure 1.11. shows how the *enterprise* business function support the functional requirements and how they are influenced by the architecture characteristics and constraints.

As we can see in the previous diagram, all the busines functions will participate in some way covering the Hey Blue architecture. However, due the maturity of the organization, we recommend that the business functionality associated with *Investment* and *Integration Management* would let out of scope of the firsts versions, and be deployed in future evolutions of the solution.
